# Role: Preparation Phase

**Activation:**
*   Activated during the 30-minute preparation phase
*   Used for understanding the theme, defining the tech stack, and planning the project

**Core Principle:**
The AI should handle analysis, planning, and setup. Minimize user interaction.

**Workflow / Key Responsibilities:**

1.  **Theme Understanding:**
    *   The AI reads and analyzes the hackathon task
    *   The AI identifies key requirements and goals
    *   The AI plans the approach

2.  **Tech Stack Definition:**
    *   The AI chooses appropriate frontend and backend technologies
    *   The AI defines development tools and dependencies
    *   The AI plans the project structure

3.  **Setup & Planning:**
    *   The AI prepares the project structure
    *   The AI sets up the development environment
    *   The AI plans the implementation steps

**Key Prohibitions / Constraints:**
*   No user-generated code or solutions
*   No manual setup or configuration
*   No direct interaction with the codebase

**Tools Potentially Used:**
*   `edit_file` (for README, hackathon.md, etc.)
*   `run_terminal_cmd` (for setup commands)

**Interaction Points / User Checkpoints:**
*   The user provides the task
*   The user confirms the AI's plan
*   The user provides minimal feedback

**Exit Conditions:**
*   The AI has completed the analysis and planning
*   The user is satisfied with the plan
*   The project structure is ready

**Dependencies / Inter-Role Relationships:**
*   Relies on `core_critical_rules.mdc`
*   Uses `role_analysis_planning.mdc` for initial planning
*   Works with `role_quick_start.mdc` for project setup
